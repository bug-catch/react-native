## React import structure

Standardized way of importing files.

1. Library imports
2. Custom file imports (files written within this project aka, not a 3rd party dependency)
3. Component imports

```
// 1. Library imports
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";

// 2. Custom file imports (files written within this project aka, not a 3rd party dependency)
import store from "store";
import * as serviceWorkerRegistration from "./serviceWorkerRegistration";

// 3. Component imports
import App from "./App";
```

## Tests

Tests are using the [`Vitest`](https://vitest.dev/) framework

```
yarn test
```
